    <p>The famous &#8220;Prairie Dog,&#8221; or &#8220;Prairie Squirrel,&#8221; exists in great
abundance on the plains west of the Missouri River, being also found
over a large extent of country at the southward, and it has also been
<span id="page82" role="doc-pagebreak" aria-label="82"/>
observed as far west as California. At the southward, Captain Marcy
found it above Cross Timbers, on the Red River of Louisiana. Though
not properly included among the mammals of this region, this squirrel
has more resemblance to our grey spermophile in color, and to
the wood-chuck (<span class="taxon">Arctomys monax</span>) in form,
than to any other known to our farmers.
Its habits are not unlike those of our grey and striped spermophiles.
Like them, it is strictly a prairie animal,
subsisting upon plants, and probably on some insects.</p>
    <p>The prairie dogs are fond of each other’s company, and live
together, in great congregations, their numerous burrows, situated
close together, being called &#8220;prairie-dog towns.&#8221; The burrow is
much deeper and more extensive than that of either of our two Illinois
prairie-squirrels. Like these, it is fond of standing erect near
its hole, ventures from it with caution, and hastens into it when
alarmed; but, as if it were inquisitive, soon puts out its head again
to look at the cause of its fright. Like the rest of the genus. it
hibernates. Its note is said to have gained it the name of &#8220;Prairie
Dog,&#8221; but its voice can scarcely bear much resemblance to the bark
of a dog, and is probably more like the whistling chatter of our
grey and striped spermophiles, though perhaps less musical and clear.</p>
    <p>Numbers of our common [Sic] prairie rattlesnakes
(<span class="taxon">Crotalophorus tergeminus</span>)<sup><a href="#footnote.1" epub:type="noteref" role="doc-noteref">[1]</a></sup>,
as well as of a small owl, live habitually in the burrows
of the prairie-dog. These can hardly be welcome guests of the
rightful inhabitants. Though the owl probably feeds chiefly upon
insects, it might devour the young; and the rattlesnake certainly
does, as well as makes many a meal of the adults.</p>

The author is almost certainly referring to the Massasauga (<span class="taxon">Sistrus catenatus</span>) [Rafinesque, <time>1818</time>]. There is a subspecies with the trinomial name <span class="taxon">S. c. tergeminus</span> [Say, <time>1823</time>] and while that subspecies is not present in Illinois, the Massasauga species is present in Illinois and is sometime colloquially called the Prairie Rattlesnake.</p>
<p>The actual Prairie Rattlesnake (<span class="taxon">Crotalus viridis</span>) [Rafinesque, <time>1818</time>] is not currently or historically known to be present in Illinois.</p></aside>
