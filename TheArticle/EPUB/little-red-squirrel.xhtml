This is full a third smaller than the migratory squirrel; the hairs clothing the body are much shorter, and
the tail less bushy. There are no distinct varieties though the colors of the
upper parts are sometimes&#8212;if not generally, at the East&#8212;much redder than
in the specimen here described, being without the dorsal stripe of a color so
different from that of the rest of the back. Other specimens from Ohio are
colored like that described.</p>

  <p>This pretty and active little animal is well known through the
Northern States, under the names of

It is a
<span id="page68" role="doc-pagebreak" aria-label="68"/>
Northern species, but has a wide geographical range. It is found
abundantly throughout the Eastern and Middle States, and probably
exists as far to the northward as the pine and spruce occur. Southward,
in the Atlantic States, it is found in the mountains of Virginia,
and, according to Audubon and Bachman, it has even been
seen within North Carolina. In the interior, it abounds in Ohio
and Indiana, and is found sparingly in heavy timber in Illinois;
but it is not common, if it occurs at all, in the southern parts of
these States. West of the Mississippi, it has rarely been seen in
Northern Missouri. It is found in Central Iowa, and is abundant
in parts of Southeastern Minnesota, where, in fact, it is the only
species. About Lake Superior, in Northern Minnesota and Wisconsin,
where no other squirrel prevails, it is found in exceeding abundance.
It probably exists further to the west, but on the other side
of the Rocky Mountains it is replaced by other small species closely
resembling it.</p>
  <p>The natural home of this squirrel is in heavy timber on high land.
It is not found in the small, sparsely-timbered prairie groves, nor in
the oak openings. It loves to take up its residence among evergreens,
the cones of which form its favorite food, those of the black-spruce
particularly. In cultivated districts, it sometimes departs
from its natural habits. It becomes accustomed to man’s presence,
living sometimes in trees quite near dwellings, and frequently in
out-houses, in winter, when it comes fearlessly about the house and
corn-crib. It is attached to its home, and will not leave its favorite
tree unless much molested.</p>
  <p>Unlike any other of the true squirrels found here, this species
sometimes, but not generally, lives in holes in the ground. Unlike
the others, too, it collects into its hole in autumn an ample provision
of the good things of squirrel life, wherewith to console and sustain
itself in the uncomfortable season of frost and snow. It is well
known that the chickaree makes large hoards of nuts, acorns, and
seeds. These are deposited in hollow trees, and sometimes under
fallen logs, and even occasionally in holes in the ground. In
consequence of his good cheer, this squirrel is seen actively scampering
about in cold weather, when his hungry cousins cannot pluck up
courage to leave their warm abodes, even in search of food. In the
corn-field, his depredations are at times the source of much annoyance
to the farmer. Besides eating at the time with others, this
provident species is said to carry off corn to its hole for winter use.</p>
