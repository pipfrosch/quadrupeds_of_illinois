On the back and sides there are nine stripes of a dark brown
color, with a row of yellowish dots along each of the five central stripes, which
are the broadest and most distinct. Alternating with these brown stripes, are
eight narrow lines of yellowish-grey; thus making seventeen in all, which
shows Mitchill’s name to not be very characteristic. The lower lines are
indistinct, and in some specimens, cannot be traced. The under parts of the
body are yelllowish-brown.</p>

    <p>This little animal, so well known on our prairies, resembles the
common chipmuck
(<span class="taxon">Tamias striatus</span>), and is of about the same size,
or a little longer. It abounds in the prairies of

  <span role="listitem">Minnesota,</span>
  <span role="listitem">Iowa,</span>

  <span role="listitem">Middle and Northern Illinois,</span>
  <span role="listitem">and Northern Indiana.</span>
</span>
It is only found in the northern edge of Missouri.
In Illinois, it is most abundant in the northern part of the State;
and it does not exist at all below latitude thirty-nine
degrees, if it does as far south as that. It is not found east of the
prairie regions, nor oak openings, of Indiana and Michigan, except
<span id="page75" role="doc-pagebreak" aria-label="75"/>
rarely in the northeastern corner of Ohio. At the North, Richardson
found it towards latitude fifyt-five degrees, in the British Possessions;
it has been seen as far west as Fort Laramie, on Platte River. Audubon
and Bachman state that it is found abundantly on the Upper Missouri,
and that it is said to extend along the prairies east of
the Rocky Mountains into Mexico.</p>
    <p>In Iowa, Wisconsin, and Northern Illinois where this animal is
abundant and much complained of by farmers, it is universally
called &#8220;gopher.&#8221; The true gopher
(<span class="taxon">Pseudostoma bursarius</span>)<sup><a href="#footnote.2" epub:type="noteref" role="doc-noteref">[2]</a></sup> being
also found in Iowa and Illinois, the two animals are frequently
confounded; and such is the profound contempt of some farmers
for any systematic study of natural history, that, though repeated
descriptions of both these animals have been published in various
agricultural journals, they go on correcting each other’s statements,
after a fashion, in preference to learning first what they
are writing about. One, who knows only the true gopher, burrows
of which are miles in length, very naturally laughs at
another for saying he drowns out hundreds of gophers, (meaning
prairie-squirrels,) by pouring a pailful or two of water into a
burrow; while the latter must be very careless, to state that
gophers cut the roots of trees, gnaw vegetables, and injur fields by
throwing up hills. The <span class="taxon">Pseudostoma</span> undoubtedly has the best
right to the name of &#8220;gopher,&#8221; and should retain it. Our farmers
would obviate needless and frequent confusion, if they would not
apply the same name to the present species, for which the designation
&#8220;Striped Prairie Squirrel&#8221; would be far more appropriate;
and which, in fact, is highly characteristic, being in itself a
description of the animal. To call it &#8220;Ground Squirrel,&#8221; as is
sometimes done, is bad, because the
<span class="taxon">Tamias striatus</span> is well known as
the &#8220;Striped Ground Squirrel.&#8221; In Northern Illinois, I have
heard the German farmers very generally call it &#8220;Fence Mouse,&#8221;
which name they also apply to the <span class="taxon">Tamias striatus</span>.</p>
    <p>This species is emphatically a prairie animal. It never inhabits
timber lands when there is prairie in the vicinity. Though it may
be found in oak openings, it is never in heavy timber; and, when
living in these openings, it is always most abundant on the edges
of open ground, or where the trees are most scattering.</p>
    <p>I am not aware that this prairie-squirrel ever inhabits
ravines,<sup><a href="#footnote.author" epub:type="noteref" role="doc-noteref">[&#9830;]</a></sup>
in preference to level ground, though
<span class="taxon">Spermophilus franklinii</span><sup><a href="#footnote.3" epub:type="noteref" role="doc-noteref">[3]</a></sup>
sometimes appears fond of burrowing in banks. The favorite habitation
of this species is on dry prairie knolls. It is naturally gregarious,
and though never observed living in such great companies as the
prairie-dog, twenty, or sometimes even fifty or a hundred may be
found within the area of an acre, two burrows being frequently
within a few feet of each other, though one is never inhabited by
<span id="page76" role="doc-pagebreak" aria-label="76"/>
more than a pair. In passing near a knoll inhabited by them,
numbers may be seen standing upright at the entrance of their
burrows, so straight and motionless as to be easily mistaken for as
many sticks. But, as you approach one, he will disappear, by a
movement so rapid that he can scarcely be followed by the eye; and,
if it were not for the whistling chatter accompanying his disappearance,
you might think your vision had deceived you, and that
nothing had been there. But upon stepping back several rods, it
is more than likely that he will have resumed his position before
you are aware of it. If you remain close to his hole, he will only
thrust out his head and eye you suspiciously.</p>
    <p>The striped spermophile leaves its burrow with great caution, and
only for a short distance. At the slightest alarm it silently glides
back through the grass, yet with great rapidity, keeping close to
the ground and never leaping. Its burrow reached, unless closely
pursued, it stops for a moment at the entrance, sitting upright on
the tarsi, and then suddenly pops into the hole, uttering several
quick, clear, whisteling notes. Unless it has been very much alarmed,
it ill always thrust out its head again to reconnoitre; and boys,
taking advantage of this practice, often catch these animals by
slipping a noose arranged over the hole, the moment one has entered.
When one is shot near his burrow, the body can seldom be secured,
for, like the prairie-dog, unless cut to pieces by the shot, he will
manage to tumble into his hole.</p>
    <p>Before the production of the young, in May or June, the old male
leaves the female, and appears to lead a solitary and more or less
wandering life, digging a temporary burrow, or occupying a deserted
one for a few days, wherever he may take up his abode. These
summer burrows may often be found, and sometimes are of considerable
extent; several of those which were examined were more than 20
feet in length, being simple galleries from six inches to a foot below
the surface&#8212;deeper in sandy soil&#8212;opening at both ends, with the
nest placed in a small side-chamber; others were of much less
extent, sometimes with but one entrance, and sometimes without
nests. The winter burrow, in which the pair hibernate and the
female brings forth her young, is deeper and more complicated, having
always two entrances or more. In this, in a side-chamber of
suitable size, excavated above the level of the rest of the burrow, is a
large spherical nest of soft grass, entered by an opening on one side.
This nest is sometimes of the size of a half bushel, the interior
being generally lined with softer material than the outside. The
young are produced at the end of May or early in June. I have
observed from five to nine brought forth at a birth, and I am
informed of two instances in which ten were found in a nest; but
the number is variable, the usual number being six or seven. The
young at birth are naked, blind, and remarkably embryonic. <abbr>Dr.</abbr>
Hoy, who observed them in confinement, says that they have no
hair on the body before they are twenty days old, and that the eyes
do not open till the thirteenth day. They continue to require the
nourishment and care of the mother for a much longer period than
