  <h1 id="chapter.label">Needed Photographs</h1>
  <p>This is a list of high resolution photographs needed to complete this project. Any help would be appreciated.</p>
  <p>I can be contacted at <a href="mailto:pipfroschpress@gmail.com">pipfroschpress@gmail.com</a></p>

    <h2 id="efs.label">Eastern Fox Squirrel</h2>
    <p>Specifically needed is a photograph of <span class="taxon">Sciurus niger vulpinus</span>.</p>
    <p>Photographs I have found online claiming to be this subspecies that could potentially used either have a stated locale outside the range of this subspecies, or do not state a locale and look suspiciously like <span class="taxon">Sciurus niger rufiventer</span>.</p>
    <p>This squirrel use to be present in the southen part of Pennsylvania but apparently is either exceedingly rare there now, or has been extirpated.</p>
    <p>It is reportedly still present within six counties of North Carolina at the northern end of the Blue Mountain range, and also in Virgina west of the Blue Mountains.</p>
    <p>My preference would be from North Carolina part of the range in a state park away from heavy urban areas, as <span class="taxon">Sciurus niger rufiventer</span> is often introduced in urban areas. There are several state parks there, I am guessing one of them has a healthy population.</p>
    <p>See <a href="https://www.ncwildlife.org/Portals/0/Learning/documents/Profiles/Mammals/Fox_Squirrel.pdf" title="Intenet Resource">Fox Squirrel&#8212;North Carolina Wildlife Profiles</a> (<abbr>PDF</abbr>) for a range map.</p>
    <p>Note that two subspecies of <span class="taxon">Sciurus niger</span> are in North Carolina. <span class="taxon"><abbr>S.</abbr> <abbr>n.</abbr> vulpinus</span> is the smaller range shown on the map, where North Carolina hits Tennessee and Virginia.</p>

  <section id="black" aria-labelledby="black.label">
    <h2 id="black.label">Melanistic Western Fox Squirrel</h2>
    <p>I need a photograph of a Melanistic (black) squirrel that is unquestionably a Western Fox Squirrel (<span class="taxon">Sciurus niger rufiventer</span>) and not a Gray Squirrel (<span class="taxon">Sciurus carolinensis</span>).</p>
    <p>Preferably this would be within the range of <span class="taxon">Sciurus niger rufiventer</span> but <strong>outside</strong> the range of <span class="taxon">Sciurus carolinensis</span>.</p>
    <p>This photograph would replace <a href="photo5.xhtml">Photo 5</a> which is not positively identified at the species level and which I suspect is actually <span class="taxon">Sciurus carolinensis</span>.</p>
  </section>
  <section id="red" aria-labelledby="red.label">
    <h2 id="red.label">Red Squirrel</h2>
    <p>I need a photograph of <span class="taxon">Tamiasciurus hudsonicus</span> from Illinois or Wisconsin.</p>
    <p>The photograph I have is beautiful but it is from Alaska, which is not exactly the western Great Lakes region.</p>
    <p>This photograph would replace <a href="photo7.xhtml">Photo 7</a>.</p>
  </section>
  <section id="sfs" aria-labelledby="sfs.label">
    <h2 id="sfs.label">Southern Flying Squirrel</h2>
    <p>Preferably from Illinois or Wisconsin, I need to have a quality photograph of <span class="taxon">Glaucomys volans</span>.</p>
    <p>Given the highly nocturnal nature of this species and the desire for the gliding membrane to be exposed, a posed taxidermy specimen may be what is required, but please do not kill one for that purpose. Hopefully a natural history museum that allows photographs has one.</p>
