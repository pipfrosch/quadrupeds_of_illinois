  <h1 id="chapter.label">To Do List</h1>
  <p>This digital book currently does an adequate job at representing the original content of the author.</p>
  <p>There are however improvements that will be hopefully made:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Glossary entries need to be made for every term that could be confusing to a student in junior high school. If you aware of a term that needs a glossary entry, please feel free to file a bug report (issue) at the <a href="https://github.com/pipfrosch/quadrupeds_of_illinois/issues" title="Internet Resource">github issues page</a>.</li>
    <li id="photo">
      <p>Obtain quality photographs as specified in the <a href="needed-photos.xhtml">Needed Photographs</a> appendix section that follows.</p>
      <p>Whenever possible, I do attempt to acquire existing quality photographs that have a compatible license, but I am somewhat picky when it comes to quality.</p>
      <p>Whenever possible, I will attempt to provide photographs myself. Unfortunately, I am a long ways away from where many of the animals described in this paper are found, and my own photographs frequently do not meet my quality expectations. I must concede that many high school students with an artistic eye and no formal photography training take better photographs than I do.</p>
      <p>When freely available photographs are not available, I would like to be able to offer a $50 bounty for a suitable photograph <em>especially</em> if the photographer is a life sciences student or recent graduate but I do not have that kind of budget. Donations specified for that purpose would help.</p>
      <p>If you do have photographic ability and access to the species in the list, please contact me. I can not pay unless donations for that purpose have come in</p>
