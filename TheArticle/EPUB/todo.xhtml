  <h1 id="chapter.label">To Do List</h1>
  <p>This digital book currently does an adequate job at representing the original content of the author.</p>
  <p>There are however improvements that will be hopefully made:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Glossary entries need to be made for every term that could be confusing to a student in junior high school. If you aware of a term that needs a glossary entry, please feel free to file a bug report (issue) at the <a href="https://github.com/pipfrosch/quadrupeds_of_illinois/issues" title="Internet Resource">github issues page</a>.</li>
    <li>
      <p>The reproduced plates from the original article are not of the quality I would like and <em>may</em> have legal issues.</p>
      <p>The original article is in the public domain but the way <abbr>U. S.</abbr> copyright law works, a new copyright is assigned to a photograph or scan of another work.</p>
      <p>I would like higher quality images of those plates, with a clear right to use them in an Open Access Creative Commons <a href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/legalcode" title="Internet Resource">BY-SA 4.0</a> publication.</p>
      <p>The easiest way to ensure this is to obtain a copy of the original publication and photograph the plates myself. I do watch eBay but so far have not seen this paper sold there, though I have seen Patent Office reports from very near this date sold there, so there is hope it may turn up there someday.</p>
      <p>It is quite possible, even probable, that this publication exists in good condition in an academic institution library that could facilitate quality reproduction of the plates.</p>
      <p>A minimum horizontal resolution of 1024 pixels is desired because that resolution would allow the digital publication to be used in a classroom environment with a projector and still avoid pixelation. Higher resolutions would potentially allow some digital restoration to the images prior to downsampling to a 1024x resolution.</p>
    </li>
    <li>The illustrators for the original plates need to be identified so that proper credit can be given.</li>
    <li id="photo">
      <p>Obtain quality photographs as specified in the <a href="needed-photos.xhtml">Needed Photographs</a> appendix section that follows.</p>
      <p>Whenever possible, I do attempt to acquire existing quality photographs that have a compatible license, but I am somewhat picky when it comes to quality.</p>
      <p>Whenever possible, I will attempt to provide photographs myself. Unfortunately, I am a long ways away from where many of the animals described in this paper are found, and my own photographs frequently do not meet my quality expectations. I must concede that many high school students with an artistic eye and no formal photography training take better photographs than I do.</p>
      <p>When freely available photographs are not available, I would like to be able to offer a $50 bounty for a suitable photograph <em>especially</em> if the photographer is a life sciences student or recent graduate but I do not have that kind of budget. Donations specified for that purpose would help.</p>
      <p>If you do have photographic ability and access to the species in the list, please contact me. I can not pay unless donations for that purpose have come in</p>
    </li>
    <li>The ePub specification allows for phonetic markup. At this time, ePub viewers do not support this part of the specification, but hopefully in the near future they will. Phonetic pronunciation of words that are likely to be mispronounced by Text-To-Speech (<abbr>TTS</abbr>) synthesizers need to be added. Some already have been added, but a careful analysis of all content needs to be done to identify additional cases where phonetic markup is warranted.</li>
  </ul>
