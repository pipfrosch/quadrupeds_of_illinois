In spring, the hairs on the upper parts
are
<a href="glossary.xhtml#pugnacious" epub:type="glossref" role="doc-glossref">plumbeous</a>
at the base, tipped with ashy and yellowish-brown; a few
longer hairs, entirely black, interspersed. The tips of most of the hairs
deepen into black along the back, giving a broad, black stripe, when the hair
lies flat. In some specimens, this stripe is not so dark as in others, but is
quite distinct in all, while in some it is pitch-black. On the upper lip, and
entire under parts of the body and legs, the hairs are plumbeous at the base,
tipped with pure white. The cheeks and lower edges of the color of the
upper parts, are yellowish, forming a border between the colors of the belly
and back. There is a distinct line of demarcation between this yellow border
and the white belly. On each side of the root of the tail is a bright
brownish-yellow spot, formed by the termination of the yellowish line on the
side. The hairs immediately about the root of the tail are ashy-brown.
The ears, upper part of the tail, and a distinct spot on the top of the fore-foot,
are brownish-black. The nails and toes of all the feet, and the tops of
the fore-feet, back to the blackish spot, are pure, creamy-white. In some
specimens, the the hind-foot is white nearly back to the heel; in others, it is
ashy-brown along the top, and white at the sides. The white of the under
parts of the fore-arm extends sometimes quite, at others nearly, around on
top, behind the blackish spot. The ears are as well clothed, and with as
long hairs, as those of summer specimens of <span class="taxon">Mus leucopus</span>; and the edges
are whitish. The incisors are yellowish, those in the upper jaw darker than
in the last-named species. The whiskers, situated anteriorly, are white, and
those further back entirely black. The comparative number of white and
<span id="page93" role="doc-pagebreak" aria-label="93"/>
black whiskers varies much in different specimens. When young, the upper
parts are dark ashy-brown; darker along the back, and faintly tinged with
yellowish on the cheeks, sides, and flanks. Like the preceding, this species
varies a good deal in size, and somewhat in the shades of coloring. This
mouse may be distinguished at once from its nearly allied
<a href="glossary.xhtml#congener" epub:type="glossref" role="doc-glossref">congener</a> the
<span class="taxon">Mus michiganensis</span><sup><a href="#footnote.1" epub:type="noteref" role="doc-noteref">[1]</a></sup>,
of Audubon and Bachman, which <abbr>Dr.</abbr> Hoy has
detected inhabiting the open woods near Racine, by its pure white belly, and
by the distinct line of demarcation between the color of the belly and the
yellowish-brown border on the sides. It will be very generally mistaken for
the <span class="taxon">Mus leucopus</span>, which it much resembles in form and color. Upon
comparison, it may be readily distinguished, however, by its smaller size, much
shorter tail, darker color, with usually a black dorsal stripe, more distinct
than that in the <span class="taxon">Mus leucopus</span>, and by its having the upper part of the tarsi
ashy-brown instead of pure white, as in that species. Moreover, the one
always inhabits the prairie, and the other the woods.</p>
