  <p>The true squirrel is arboreal. His home is in the trees, and his
legitimate food their fruits and buds. Should he go to the ground,
it is only in search of food; and, this obtained, he returns to his airy
dwelling-place. Here, in summer, he builds him a nest of leaves
taken from the branches at hand, and in a hole in the same tree, or
in one that he can attain by springing from branch to branch without
going to the ground, he has a more secure retreat, to which he
can retire during inclement weather, or escape the attacks of an
enemy, and in which the young are generally reared.</p>
