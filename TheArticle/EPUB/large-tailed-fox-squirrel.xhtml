  <p>The general color of the fox-squirrel is mixed, grey and black
above and reddish yellow below; the hairs on the back are bluish-black
at the base, broadly ringed with brown, more narrowly with
<span id="page56" role="doc-pagebreak" aria-label="56"/>
black, then with greyish-white, and slightly tipped with black; a
few hairs extend beyond the rest, the extra length of these being
entirely black. The hairs on the top of the tail have three black
and three light - brown rings alternately , broadly tipped with
reddish-yellow. On the sides and tip of the tail, the hairs are for
two thirds of their length reddish-yellow, then ringed once more
with black, and broadly tipped with darker reddish-yellow; on the
under surface of the tail, the hairs are entirely of a bright reddish-yellow.
Thus the under side of the tail is of a deep reddish-yellow,
surrounded by a distinct subterminal band of black, beyond which it
is edged with the color of the centre; the upper surface of the tail
is mixed, brown and black, beautifully edged with a terminal band
of reddish-yellow. The cheeks, upper lips, the space around the
eyes, ears, feet, and entire under parts of the body and legs are of a
rich reddish-yellow. The hairs on the belly are ashen for a short
distance at the base. The whiskers are entirely black. The toes
and soles of the feet are also black; nails black tipped with white;
incisors deep reddish orange. One remarkable feature in this species
is that the bones are tinged with red. Summer specimens are
of lighter colors, with the hair much thinner and shorter, and
without the thick coat of long hair on the posterior surface of the
ear.</p>
  <p>With one exception, I have seen no distinct varieties of color in
this species. In some specimens, at different seasons, the color of
the underparts, however, grades from light-yellow to deep reddish-orange;
and a summer specimen, obtained in Missouri by <abbr>Dr.</abbr> P.
R. Hoy, of Racine, Wisconsin, has the under parts of a dark-rufous
cast. This specimen is also blacker than usual on the back, and
comes nearer to Audobon and Bachman’s figure of <span class="taxon"><abbr>S.</abbr> sayi</span>
than any other I have seen. This and other specimens of the two
extremes of coloring in other respects are alike.</p>
  <p>A variety of this species is occassionally met with in which the
tail and upper parts are of the usual colors, but with the entire
under parts of the body perfectly black. It has only been observed
in Southern Wisconsin and Northern Illinois.</p>
  <p>I have thus minutely described this squirrel because Audubon
and Bachman have, in their
&#8220;<span class="worktitle">Quadrupeds of North America</span>,&#8221;
made two species of it. It is undoubtedly the <span class="taxon"><abbr>S.</abbr> magnicaudatus</span>, of
Harlan, first described by Say, who unfortunately gave it a name
already belonging to another squirrel. Under the name of <span class="taxon"><abbr>S.</abbr> sayi</span>,
Audubon and Bachman have described a specimen of this species,
of unusually bright colors, their highly-colored figure exaggerating
the hue of the under parts to a bright orange-red, or ferruginous.
This they give as the &#8220;Great-tailed Squirrel&#8221; of Say, Godman,
and Harlan, and as being an abundant species in Illinois. But,
among hundreds of specimens both from Northern and Southern
Illinois, as well as from Michigan, Indiana, and Wisconsin,
examined in the Chicago markets and elsewhere, I never saw one
corresponding fully to the figure and description of <span class="taxon"><abbr>S.</abbr> sayi</span> given
by the authors named above. The figure and description of their
<span id="page57" role="doc-pagebreak" aria-label="57"/>
<span class="taxon"><abbr>S.</abbr> rubricaudatus</span>, were taken from a young specimen of this species
in summer pelage of rather light color.</p>
  <p>In its home at the West, this large and beautiful species is
universally known under the name of &#8220;Fox-squirrel,&#8221; and, though
other American species are also called by this name, it would be
useless now to attempt to apply another. This squirrel has been
observed throughout Illinois, in Southern Wisconsin, Eastern Iowa,
Southern Michigan, Western Indiana, and, according to <abbr>Dr.</abbr> Hoy,
throughout the northern part of Missouri, as far as the Osage
River, at least, and in Eastern Kansas. I have also seen it from
Western Kentucky, where I am informed it abounds, as well as in
Southeastern Missouri, and it will probably be found in other States
further to the south and west. Captain Marcy saw a species he
supposed to be the <span class="taxon"><abbr>S.</abbr> magnicaudatus</span>
as far south as the Red River of
Louisiana. In
<span role="list">
  <span role="listitem">Northern Michigan,</span>
  <span role="listitem">Northern Wisconsin,</span>
  <span role="listitem">Northern Iowa,</span>
  <span role="listitem">and in Minnesota</span>
</span>,
I am informed it does not exist, and its
northern limit appears to be between the forty-third and forty-fifth
parallels of north lattitude, though further north it is said to be
found in Eastern Michigan. Several specimens of this species have
been seen in Ohio, but their appearance is explained by the fact that
several individuals taken in Wisconsin, are known to have been
liberated in the same locality, some time before. It is very abundant
throughout Illinois, where, in some localities, it exists in
greater numbers than any other species.</p>
  <p>The fox-squirrel loves neither low lands nor deep woods; and,
though found living in the heavily-timbered districts of Indiana and
Illinois, it is less at home in these than in more open ground. It
is properly an inhabitant of the timber of the prairie regions, and
its favorite habitat is in the &#8220;oak openings&#8221; of Wisconsin and
Michigan, and the groves or edges of the belts of timber that skirt
the streams watering the prairies of Illinois. Since these river
belts and the prairie groves, or &#8220;Islands,&#8221; as the old settlers
appropriately termed them, have been protected from the fires that
formerly swept them annually, many young trees, especially pin-oak
(<span class="taxon">Quercus palustris</span>), in Northern Illinois have sprung up around
them at the edges of the prairie, forming ornamental clumps, that
are useful as protection against the sharp prairie winds&#8212;the more
so as the pin-oak retains its leaves during winter. These are favorite
haunts of the fox-squirrel, and whenever a hollow tree of larger
size stands in one of these outlaying groves, it will be the home of
a pair. In some localities in Northern Illinois, many young pin-oaks
are destroyed by having the bark stripped from the trunks and
larger branches which kills the tops. As neither the porcupine
nor any other bark-eating mammal which can climb, is found here,
and as this squirrel is known to frequent these young pin-oaks, the
guilt has been charged upon him without further evidence than this.
It is only within a few years that this extensive destruction of the
young oaks has been observed in this vicinity, and it is yearly
increasing, while the fox-squirrels are now less numerous than
formerly, and food is more abundant, as hogs do not now consume the
<span id="page58" role="doc-pagebreak" aria-label="58"/>
mast as they did several years ago. Though the tops of hundreds
of trees have thus been killed. I have observed none gnawed in
neighboring woods where the fox-squirrels are equally numerous.</p>
