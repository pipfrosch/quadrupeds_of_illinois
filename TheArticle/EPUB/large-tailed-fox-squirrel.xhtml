  <p>The general color of the fox-squirrel is mixed, grey and black
above and reddish yellow below; the hairs on the back are bluish-black
at the base, broadly ringed with brown, more narrowly with
<span id="page56" role="doc-pagebreak" aria-label="56"/>
black, then with greyish-white, and slightly tipped with black; a
few hairs extend beyond the rest, the extra length of these being
entirely black. The hairs on the top of the tail have three black
and three light - brown rings alternately , broadly tipped with
reddish-yellow. On the sides and tip of the tail, the hairs are for
two thirds of their length reddish-yellow, then ringed once more
with black, and broadly tipped with darker reddish-yellow; on the
under surface of the tail, the hairs are entirely of a bright reddish-yellow.
Thus the under side of the tail is of a deep reddish-yellow,
surrounded by a distinct subterminal band of black, beyond which it
is edged with the color of the center; the upper surface of the tail
is mixed, brown and black, beautifully edged with a terminal band
of reddish-yellow. The cheeks, upper lips, the space around the
eyes, ears, feet, and entire under parts of the body and legs are of a
rich reddish-yellow. The hairs on the belly are ashen for a short
distance at the base. The whiskers are entirely black. The toes
and soles of the feet are also black; nails black tipped with white;
incisors deep reddish orange. One remarkable feature in this species
is that the bones are tinged with red. Summer specimens are
of lighter colors, with the hair much thinner and shorter, and
without the thick coat of long hair on the posterior surface of the
ear.</p>
  <p>With one exception, I have seen no distinct varieties of color in
this species. In some specimens, at different seasons, the color of
the underparts, however, grades from light-yellow to deep reddish-orange;
and a summer specimen, obtained in Missouri by <abbr>Dr.</abbr> P.
R. Hoy, of Racine, Wisconsin, has the under parts of a dark-rufous
cast. This specimen is also blacker than usual on the back, and
comes nearer to Audobon and Bachman’s figure of <span class="taxon"><abbr>S.</abbr> sayi</span>
than any other I have seen. This and other specimens of the two
extremes of coloring in other respects are alike.</p>
  <p>A variety of this species is occasionally met with in which the
tail and upper parts are of the usual colors, but with the entire
under parts of the body perfectly black. It has only been observed
in Southern Wisconsin and Northern Illinois.</p>
  <p>I have thus minutely described this squirrel because Audubon
and Bachman have, in their
&#8220;<span class="worktitle">Quadrupeds of North America</span>,&#8221;
made two species of it. It is undoubtedly the <span class="taxon"><abbr>S.</abbr> magnicaudatus</span>, of
Harlan, first described by Say, who unfortunately gave it a name
already belonging to another squirrel. Under the name of <span class="taxon"><abbr>S.</abbr> sayi</span>,
Audubon and Bachman have described a specimen of this species,
of unusually bright colors, their highly-colored figure exaggerating
the hue of the under parts to a bright orange-red, or ferruginous.
This they give as the &#8220;Great-tailed Squirrel&#8221; of Say, Godman,
and Harlan, and as being an abundant species in Illinois. But,
among hundreds of specimens both from Northern and Southern
Illinois, as well as from Michigan, Indiana, and Wisconsin,
examined in the Chicago markets and elsewhere, I never saw one
corresponding fully to the figure and description of <span class="taxon"><abbr>S.</abbr> sayi</span> given
by the authors named above. The figure and description of their
<span id="page57" role="doc-pagebreak" aria-label="57"/>
<span class="taxon"><abbr>S.</abbr> rubricaudatus</span>, were taken from a young specimen of this species
in summer pelage of rather light color.</p>
  <p>In its home at the West, this large and beautiful species is
universally known under the name of &#8220;Fox-squirrel,&#8221; and, though
other American species are also called by this name, it would be
useless now to attempt to apply another. This squirrel has been
observed throughout Illinois, in Southern Wisconsin, Eastern Iowa,
Southern Michigan, Western Indiana, and, according to <abbr>Dr.</abbr> Hoy,
throughout the northern part of Missouri, as far as the Osage
River, at least, and in Eastern Kansas. I have also seen it from
Western Kentucky, where I am informed it abounds, as well as in
Southeastern Missouri, and it will probably be found in other States
further to the south and west. Captain Marcy saw a species he
supposed to be the <span class="taxon"><abbr>S.</abbr> magnicaudatus</span>
as far south as the Red River of
Louisiana. In
<span role="list">
  <span role="listitem">Northern Michigan,</span>
  <span role="listitem">Northern Wisconsin,</span>
  <span role="listitem">Northern Iowa,</span>
  <span role="listitem">and in Minnesota</span>
</span>,
I am informed it does not exist, and its
northern limit appears to be between the forty-third and forty-fifth
parallels of north latitude, though further north it is said to be
found in Eastern Michigan. Several specimens of this species have
been seen in Ohio, but their appearance is explained by the fact that
several individuals taken in Wisconsin, are known to have been
liberated in the same locality, some time before. It is very abundant
throughout Illinois, where, in some localities, it exists in
greater numbers than any other species.</p>
  <p>The fox-squirrel loves neither low lands nor deep woods; and,
though found living in the heavily-timbered districts of Indiana and
Illinois, it is less at home in these than in more open ground. It
is properly an inhabitant of the timber of the prairie regions, and
its favorite habitat is in the &#8220;oak openings&#8221; of Wisconsin and
Michigan, and the groves or edges of the belts of timber that skirt
the streams watering the prairies of Illinois. Since these river
belts and the prairie groves, or &#8220;Islands,&#8221; as the old settlers
appropriately termed them, have been protected from the fires that
formerly swept them annually, many young trees, especially pin-oak
(<span class="taxon">Quercus palustris</span>), in Northern Illinois have sprung up around
them at the edges of the prairie, forming ornamental clumps, that
are useful as protection against the sharp prairie winds&#8212;the more
so as the pin-oak retains its leaves during winter. These are favorite
haunts of the fox-squirrel, and whenever a hollow tree of larger
size stands in one of these outlaying groves, it will be the home of
a pair. In some localities in Northern Illinois, many young pin-oaks
are destroyed by having the bark stripped from the trunks and
larger branches which kills the tops. As neither the porcupine
nor any other bark-eating mammal which can climb, is found here,
and as this squirrel is known to frequent these young pin-oaks, the
guilt has been charged upon him without further evidence than this.
It is only within a few years that this extensive destruction of the
young oaks has been observed in this vicinity, and it is yearly
increasing, while the fox-squirrels are now less numerous than
formerly, and food is more abundant, as hogs do not now consume the
<span id="page58" role="doc-pagebreak" aria-label="58"/>
mast as they did several years ago. Though the tops of hundreds
of trees have thus been killed. I have observed none gnawed in
neighboring woods where the fox-squirrels are equally numerous.</p>
  <p>If this bark-gnawing increases and becomes general in this vicinity,
it will be a source of much damage, as the blighted tops of the
injured trees would sadly disfigure our beautiful prairie islands in
summer. To eat bark, would be a departure from the natural habits
of this animal, and, before the guilt of being the author of this
mischief can be justly fixed upon him, better proof must be produced. It
is not impossible that some bark-gnawing rodent, hitherto unnoticed,
may exist here.</p>
  <p>But the fox-squirrel is also charged with thieving from the corn-field;
and this accusation is supported by unimpeachable evidence.
More corn is destroyed by this species than is usually supposed, the
mischief being, without investigation, very generally charged upon
the raccoons. But any of our farmers, whose corn-fields are situated
in or adjoining to timber, inhabited by it, will find that, while the
corn is in milk, many ears are opened, and, if not eaten, much
injured, or destroyed, by exposure to the weather. The small-sized
marks of the squirrel’s cutting teeth in the husks, instead of those
made by the raccoon’s widely-separated canines, and the fact that
the corn is not torn down as it would be by a heavy animal, will
sufficiently prove to him that it is not the raccoon, alone, which does
the mischief. And, if he will watch carefully some day in his corn-field,
he will detect more than one red bushy tail, whisked incessantly
up and down, as its owner, clinging to a corn-stalk, makes a
delicious meal of the milky grains. Not only does he thus eat the
corn on the stalk, but he gnaws off whole ears, which are never
eaten on the ground, but always carried to the fence, or to a neighboring
tree, where, perched upon a flat rail or large limb, he
discusses them at his leisure. Sitting upon his hind-feet, he tears off
the husk and pulls out the kernels with his teeth; and, if the corn
is in the milk, all the soft part is eaten, but, when ripened, he often
lays down the ear, and holding the kernels in his paws, only gnaws
out the germ. Along fences, or under trees, situated in or near
corn-fields thus attacked by squirrels, husks, cobs, and partly-eaten
ears of corn may frequently be found. Sometimes, when squirrels
are molested, they do not stay near the field to eat the corn, but
carry the ears off to some distance in the woods. I am informed
that when the crop of mast is scanty, large corn fields have been
destroyed in parts of Illinois and Indiana by this, and one or the
other of the two species next to be described; while fields in these
localities are more or less injured every year, especially if bordered
by timber, or with a few old trees standing in them, in which the
squirrels can take refuge, as they venture with less fear into these
fields than into those at a distance from their congenial refuge. I
have observed, however, that the fox-squirrel will leave the immediate
vicinity of trees more readily than the other species. Like
other squirrels, it will run along fence to a much greater distance
from the woods than it will travel on the ground; and, when in the
<span id="page59" role="doc-pagebreak" aria-label="59"/>
woods, it will always run upon a log in preference to keeping upon
the ground.</p>
  <p>This, as well as several other true squirrels, will sometimes,
though rarely, dig up newly-planted corn; and at times it devours
wheat and also other grain. But, usually, the only considerable
injury it does the farmer is in the destruction of corn in the ear.</p>
  <p>In the woods, the food of the fox-squirrel consists almost entirely
of the nuts and seeds of trees, with the buds of some species, including
<span role="list">
  <span role="listitem">bass-wood,</span>
  <span role="listitem">elm,</span>
  <span role="listitem">and maple</span></span>.
In autumn, it eats the fruit of
various thorns (<span class="taxon">cratægus</span>); various berries are also eaten by it, and
it is said to be particularly fond of strawberries. In common with
other squirrels, it sometimes eats insects; and it has occasionally
been observed to gnaw the bark from dead trees, to procure beetles
and their larvæ. Like other squirrels, too, it has been seen to gnaw
through the bark of trees girdled in spring, to taste the decomposing
sap. So fond of this is it that fifteen or twenty [Sic] grey-squirrels
have been seen thus engaged upon a single oak, thus girdled.</p>
  <p>It is a common opinion that this and other squirrels carry
large hoards of nuts to hollow trees for consumption in winter. So
far as our three species, common in Illinois are concerned, this is
entirely erroneous. With the exception of the little &#8220;Chickaree,&#8221; no
true squirrel that I have observed ever collects food for winter in hollow
trees. A few nut shells are sometimes found in a squirrel’s hole,
but these are only such as he has taken there to be eaten at the
time. The fox-squirrel, with the migratory and Carolina squirrels,
also, as well as others probably, buries large quantities of nuts and
acorns under the leaves in autumn, for use in winter. These, however,
are not collected together, but concealed one in a place. In
winter, the squirrels dig them up; and, when the ground is covered
with snow, numerous holes will be seen where they have dug down
to get them. It is interesting to notice that they seldom dig through
the snow and leaves in this way without coming directly upon the
buried nut or acorn, and a common idea is that the animal &#8220;remembers&#8221;
the spot. This is highly improbable. It is more reasonable
to suppose that the animal is guided by the sense of smell. <abbr>Dr.</abbr>
Hoy tells me that he has seen squirrels run about with the nose
close to the snow or leaves, and finally dig directly upon a buried
nut without hesitation. He gives it as his opinion that they can
always smell the food, unless it is buried under very deep snow. I
am not aware that corn is thus stored for winter use. Though
many nuts and acorns are buried in this way, the fox squirrel, as
observed in Northern Illinois, at least, does not depend much upon
them for food, when the snow is deep, at which time it feeds chiefly
upon buds, searching carefully, also, for the few nuts, acorns, and
seeds which may have remained upon the trees, and for the dry
berries of the <span class="taxon">Celastrus scandens</span>, and other vines or shrubs.</p>
