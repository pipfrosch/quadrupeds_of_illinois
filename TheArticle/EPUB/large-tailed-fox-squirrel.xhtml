  <p>The general color of the fox-squirrel is mixed, grey and black
above and reddish yellow below; the hairs on the back are bluish-black
at the base, broadly ringed with brown, more narrowly with
<span id="page56" role="doc-pagebreak" aria-label="56"/>
black, then with greyish-white, and slightly tipped with black; a
few hairs extend beyond the rest, the extra length of these being
entirely black. The hairs on the top of the tail have three black
and three light - brown rings alternately , broadly tipped with
reddish-yellow. On the sides and tip of the tail, the hairs are for
two thirds of their length reddish-yellow, then ringed once more
with black, and broadly tipped with darker reddish-yellow; on the
under surface of the tail, the hairs are entirely of a bright reddish-yellow.
Thus the under side of the tail is of a deep reddish-yellow,
surrounded by a distinct subterminal band of black, beyond which it
is edged with the color of the centre; the upper surface of the tail
is mixed, brown and black, beautifully edged with a terminal band
of reddish-yellow. The cheeks, upper lips, the space around the
eyes, ears, feet, and entire under parts of the body and legs are of a
rich reddish-yellow. The hairs on the belly are ashen for a short
distance at the base. The whiskers are entirely black. The toes
and soles of the feet are also black; nails black tipped with white;
incisors deep reddish orange. One remarkable feature in this species
is that the bones are tinged with red. Summer specimens are
of lighter colors, with the hair much thinner and shorter, and
without the thick coat of long hair on the posterior surface of the
ear.</p>
