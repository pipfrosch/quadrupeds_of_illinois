This is certainly the most beautiful of our rodents. In the specimen before me,
the long exquisitely soft fur, is slate-colored, tipped with creamy-yellowish
drab on the back, the top of the tail brownish-drab; on the under surface,
milk-white, tipped with cream color at the outer edges of the flying
membrane and toward the tail, the under surface of which is very light
brownish-yellow, tinged with cream. The large prominent eyes are black
and lustrous; the whiskers long, and the nearly-naked ears rather large.
The tail is densely clothed with soft hairs, and smoothly flattened; the feet
are slender with small arched nails. The skin on the side is extended
outward, to form a membrane which is attached to the legs, and to a
supplemental slender curved bone, articulating with the joint of the fore-foot.
when this membrane is stretched, the animal is enabled to sail through the
air to some distance, by the force gained in descending from any elevated
position, being aided in this by the flattened tail, which also serves as a
rudder. It is not to be supposed, however, that the flying squirrel can propel
itself through the air, like a bird or bat. The tail and membranes only form
a sort of parachute, to buoy it up while the force gained by the descent, and
by the spring made, carry it forward. When it is about to alight, it sails
upward, by using the tail and hinder parts as a rudder, the momentum
acquired being sufficient to raise it for some height at a considerable curve.</p>
