On the back, the
hairs are deep blue-black at the base, then ringed with cinnamon-brown, and
tipped with blackish, a few long hairs, entirely black, interspersed; on the
head and along the back, the color is darker. Low on the sides and cheeks
the hairs are all tipped with cinnamon-brown, without rings, as they are on
the belly also, where they are shorter and thinner, and of a bluish-grey color
at the base, thus leaving the belly bluish-grey, tinted with cinnamon. Tail
and feet, thinly clothed with short hairs; tail, brownish-grey beneath, blackish
above; feet, greyish; whiskers, shorter than the head, some entirely black,
others white, with black roots; incisors, clear light lemon-color. The old
male in spring, differs from the above, in having less black along the head
and back, with very little cinnamon on the belly, while around the root of
the tail there is a spot of dark-cinnamon. In this species the belly is usually
more or less colored with cinnamon. Summer specimens from Wisconsin
have the hair on the belly all tipped with light rusty-yellow. The young
are very dark above, with more distinct cinnamon-color on the belly in the
young of some specimens than in the adults.</p>

    <p>On the prairies in Northern Illinois and Southern Wisconsin, the
<span class="taxon">Arvicola austerus</span> exists in greater abundance than any other native
mammal, and far exceeds in numbers the other species of arvicolæ
found here. The extent of its distribution is not yet known, but it
will probably be found throughout the neighboring prairie regions.
It never has, within my knowledge, been found in the woods. It
frequents both dry and wet land, preferring the latter. In summer,
these animals inhabit low, wet prairies, in great numbers, digging
