On the back, the
hairs are deep blue-black at the base, then ringed with cinnamon-brown, and
tipped with blackish, a few long hairs, entirely black, interspersed; on the
head and along the back, the color is darker. Low on the sides and cheeks
the hairs are all tipped with cinnamon-brown, without rings, as they are on
the belly also, where they are shorter and thinner, and of a bluish-grey color
at the base, thus leaving the belly bluish-grey, tinted with cinnamon. Tail
and feet, thinly clothed with short hairs; tail, brownish-grey beneath, blackish
above; feet, greyish; whiskers, shorter than the head, some entirely black,
others white, with black roots; incisors, clear light lemon-color. The old
male in spring, differs from the above, in having less black along the head
and back, with very little cinnamon on the belly, while around the root of
the tail there is a spot of dark-cinnamon. In this species the belly is usually
more or less colored with cinnamon. Summer specimens from Wisconsin
have the hair on the belly all tipped with light rusty-yellow. The young
are very dark above, with more distinct cinnamon-color on the belly in the
young of some specimens than in the adults.</p>

    <p>On the prairies in Northern Illinois and Southern Wisconsin, the
<span class="taxon">Arvicola austerus</span> exists in greater abundance than any other native
mammal, and far exceeds in numbers the other species of arvicolæ
found here. The extent of its distribution is not yet known, but it
will probably be found throughout the neighboring prairie regions.
It never has, within my knowledge, been found in the woods. It
frequents both dry and wet land, preferring the latter. In summer,
these animals inhabit low, wet prairies, in great numbers, digging
<span id="page98" role="doc-pagebreak" aria-label="98"/>
burrows and forming nests in them, as well as on the ground among
the grass. In autumn, they retire to higher ground, to spend the
winter, being driven out of their summer homes by the heavy fall
rains. Their winter burrows on the uncultivated prairie are often
in old ant-hills, or, if not, the earth thrown out of them forms little
hillocks. They are not very deep, seldom over six inches or a foot,
but are remarkable for the numerous and complicated chambers and
side-passages of which they are composed. In one of these chambers,
considerably enlarged, is placed the nest, formed of fine, dry
grass. It is globular, from four to six inches in diameter, and with
but a small cavity in the center, which is entered by a very narrow
opening on one side. This burrow and nest are occupied in winter,
and in it at least the first litter of young is produced in spring; but,
in the summer and fall, these meadow-mice may be found in similar
nests in the grass above ground, in which the young are often, if
not usually, brought forth. Nests formed under the snow in winter
are also occupied by them. From the burrows, innumerable runways
traverse the neighborhood, intersecting those from other burrows,
thus forming a complete network so that often scarcely a
square yard can be found in an acre not crossed by one or more of
these tracks. The runways of one pair may sometimes be traced
five or ten rods on every side. These roads are not only formed for
use in winter, when the ground is covered with snow, but are also
employed as highways in summer. They are made above ground,
by pressing down and gnawing off the grass, and the earth is often
worn quite smooth and bare in those most used. The inhabitants
can travel easily along them at all times, in search of food, being
well concealed by the overarching grass. In Winter, these paths are
formed on the ground, under the snow, as well as in the grass.
The mice do not inhabit prairie pastures, where the grass is eaten
close and affords them no cover.</p>
    <p>This species is exceedingly prolific. Five young are most
commonly produced at birth; but the number varies from three to six.
They are brought forth from early in April till October; and,
in one instance, I found suckling young in the middle of November.
Of the number of litters produced in a year, I am unable to form a
certain estimate. The young, though not generally found attached
to the mother’s teats, as is the case with some other species, are at
times observed in that situation; and a female was seen to carry
three half-grown young a distance of several feet in this manner.
As soon as they are able to take care of themselves, they leave the
mother. In summer, the old males do not live with the females and
young, but are generally with the females in spring, although an
old male has been found in November with a female and her suckling
young.</p>
    <p>In their home on the prairie, the natural food of these animals is
the grasses, with their roots and seeds, as well as those of some
other plants. Various roots, indeed, form the largest portion, and
usually comprise the store of provisions collected for their winter
subsistence.</p>
