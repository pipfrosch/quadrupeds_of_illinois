    <p><strong id="description.label">Description</strong>.&#8212;Size somewhat smaller than the migratory
northern grey and black-squirrels. It is of a rusty-grey color above; on the belly, it is
pure white; the feet and face are somewhat tinged with rufous. These colors
do not vary, and the species may thus at once be distinguished from
<span class="taxon">Sciurus migratorius</span>, wherever it abounds.</p>

  <p>This species is a Southern squirrel, and is most abundant in some
of the Southern States. Audubon and Bachman say it is not
numerous in Alabama and Mississippi, and that it has not been seen
west of the Mississippi River. I have received specimens however,
from Miss Helen Tennison, of Monticello, Mississippi, who informs
me that it is common in the woods along Pearl River. It is found in
Virginia and Southern Ohio. In Southern Illinois and Indiana,
it is exceedingly abundant. At Cairo, in this State, I saw specimens
which had been shot in Kentucky, and I was told that was abundant
in the western part of that State as well as in South-eastern
Missouri. It doubtless exists throughout Kentucky and Tennessee.
<abbr>Dr.</abbr> Hoy informs me that he saw it, in considerable numbers, through
Central Missouri, along the Missouri and Osage Rivers. In the more
heavily timbered districts, along the Mississippi and Illinois Rivers,
this squirrel abounds, even in Northern Illinois. I believe it is never
found in the prairie groves nor oak openings; but in the prairie
regions, in the northern counties of this State, it is occasionally met
with in heavy timber on the low river-bottoms, or in those skirting
Lake Michigan. In this locality, it is known among hunters as the
&#8220;Silver-grey Squirrel.&#8221;
