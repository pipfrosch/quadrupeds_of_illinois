adult male measures about 12 inches from the nose to the
root of the tail; vertebr√¶ of the tail, 10&#189; inches. In color, there are two
very different varieties of this species commonly met with. One is of a
blackish-brown on the upper parts, lighter beneath and with some rusty markings
on the feet and face. The other is of a grey color, with reddish-yellow
markings about the head, belly, sides, and feet. These two varieties are
commonly considered among our farmers, as distinct species, and are respectively
called the &#8220;grey&#8221; and &#8220;black&#8221; squirrel; but any one living in the woods
may, by a little observation, satisfy himself of their identity as one species,

and the females will be found to bring forth specimens of both varieties at one
birth, and the two live and breed together without regard to color. They
are now known under the two very different names of the &#8220;black&#8221; and the
&#8220;grey&#8221; squirrel; but while there are other black and grey-squirrels, would
it not be better for our farmers to adopt the highly appropriate name of the
&#8220;migratory squirrel&#8221; for this species&#8212;the more so as Audubon and Bachman
have, with good taste, given this as its specific name?</p>
