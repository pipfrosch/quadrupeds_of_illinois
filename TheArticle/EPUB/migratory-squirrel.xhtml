    <p><strong id="description.label">Description</strong>.&#8212;The
adult male measures about 12 inches from the nose to the
root of the tail; vertebræ of the tail, 10&#189; inches. In color, there are two
very different varieties of this species commonly met with. One is of a
blackish-brown on the upper parts, lighter beneath and with some rusty markings
on the feet and face. The other is of a grey color, with reddish-yellow
markings about the head, belly, sides, and feet. These two varieties are
commonly considered among our farmers, as distinct species, and are respectively
called the &#8220;grey&#8221; and &#8220;black&#8221; squirrel; but any one living in the woods
may, by a little observation, satisfy himself of their identity as one species,
<span id="page63" role="doc-pagebreak" aria-label="63"/>
and the females will be found to bring forth specimens of both varieties at one
birth, and the two live and breed together without regard to color. They
are now known under the two very different names of the &#8220;black&#8221; and the
&#8220;grey&#8221; squirrel; but while there are other black and grey-squirrels, would
it not be better for our farmers to adopt the highly appropriate name of the
&#8220;migratory squirrel&#8221; for this species&#8212;the more so as Audubon and Bachman
have, with good taste, given this as its specific name?</p>

  <p>The grey squirrel is the most abundant, and, it is said, sometimes
exists in great numbers where none of the black ones are found.
The black variety, however, is sometimes, though rarely, the most
numerous in certain localities. In a lot of near fifty, shot near
the Rock River in Illinois, there was not a single grey one, all
being of the black variety.</p>
  <p>In the Northern States, the migratory squirrel replaces the
<span class="taxon">Sciurus carolinensis</span>,
of the South. It exists throughout the Eastern, Middle
and in some of the Western States, and is said by Audubon and
Bachman to be found as far north as Hudson’s Bay. In Illinois, it
exists only in the northern part of the State, being replaced by the
Carolina grey-squirrel in the South. It exists abundantly in Northern
Illinois, Southern Wisconsin, and Central Iowa, but to the
northward, I am informed by <abbr>Dr.</abbr> Spear B. Davis, of Shakepee,
Scott county, Minnesota, that it is not observed in the southeastern
portion of that Territory. I learn from <abbr>Dr.</abbr> Hoy that it does not
exist in Northern Wisconsin. Audubon and Bachman, however,
mention its being found on the Upper Missouri.</p>
  <p>This is the most abundant of our American squirrels. It has a
wide geographical range, and is prolific, and in many localities
exists in almost incredible abundance. The immense numbers,
heretofore mentioned as killed in one year for the bounty offered by
Pennsylvania, were chiefly of this species. In Northern Ohio, I
have seen them in such numbers as to to be truly astonishing. <abbr>Dr.</abbr>
Hoy relates that he knew a hunter in that State to kill one hundred
and sixty in a day, and that, too, when they were not unusually
abundant in the locality. In parts of Michigan, Illinois, Southern
Wisconsin, and Indiana, they are no less numerous. Existing in
such myriads, their depredations, of course, become at times a source
of serious damage to the farmer. Fields of corn, and occasionally
wheat, are much injured or entirely destroyed by them. I am
informed that persons have sometimes kept watch in their fields to
drive them off, and thus prevent the destruction of the whole crop.
This species appears to increase in numbers, in certain districts, for
a time after their settlement.</p>
