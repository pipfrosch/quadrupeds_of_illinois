    <p>This beautiful and familiar little animal, with several other
species, compose the genus <span class="taxon">Tamias</span>. Though closely related to the

true squirrels, they differ in habits and organization from their
larger kindred, to suit their life on the ground. All the ground
squirrels are of small size, living in burrows in the earth, and not
habitually climbing trees. Their form is adapted to running on
the ground and burrowing. They have capacious cheek-pouches, in
which they carry large quantities of food to store up for winter
provisions.</p>
    <p>The chipmuck exists throughout the Eastern, Middle, as well
as in some of the Western States, and as far north as latitude
fifty degrees in the British Possessions. It is found in Minnesota,
Iowa, and rarely, in Northern Missouri. I did not observe this
species in the heavily timbered districts of Southern Illinois, and
Colonel Ashley, of Jonesborough, informs me, it is rare, if found at
all, in the southern part of the State. Though abundant in the
prairie regions of Illinois, this species never leaves the woods. It
is well known to every farmer living within its habitat, under the
name of

</span>
Audubon and Bachman say it is called &#8220;Hackee&#8221; at
the East; but I have never heard that name applied to it here.</p>
    <p>Wherever it abounds, the chipmuck attracts attention by its
beauty, industrious habits, and cheerful activity. Not being a tree
climber&#8212;and, in fact, preferring somewhat open ground to deep
woods&#8212;nor fearing the neighborhood of man, it is found most
abundantly burrowing under stumps, logs, or fences about cultivated
land, and seems rather to increase than diminish in numbers, as the
forests it inhabits are cleared for cultivation.</p>
