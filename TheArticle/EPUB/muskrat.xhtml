    <p><strong id="description.label">Description</strong>.&#8212;A full-grown muskrat is about 15 inches in length, from nose
to root of tail, and the tail is 10 inches. The body is heavy, eyes small, ears
concealed, and incisor teeth large; the tail large, nearly naked, and flattened
laterally; legs, short, hind-feet, with the toes flattened and partly palmated;
beneath the long hair is a coat of dense, soft and very warm fur; color of
the body, ashy-brown above, ashy on the underparts.</p>

    <p>The muskrat, or &#8220;Musquash,&#8221; abounds in the greater part of
North America, though not in certain of the Southeastern States.
It is found northward to the Polar Sea. It is strictly aquatic, its
stout tail and muscular hind-legs, being provided with broad feet
and toes, furnish it efficient means of locomotion in the water, while
its thick, downy fur protects it from the wet. On land, its movements
are as awkward as those of a duck. It naturally seeks its
food in the water, away from which it never takes up its abode.</p>
    <span id="page106" role="doc-pagebreak" aria-label="106"/>
    <p>Though frequently seen abroad by day, muskrats are nocturnal,
moving mostly by night. They are to some extent gregarious, a
number uniting to make houses and burrows. In most localities,
where the situation admits of it, they construct houses in the water
with much skill; in marshes and ponds, or along sluggish streams,
when protected from the current, they form large piles of sticks,
leaves, rushes, carices, and various aquatic plants, the whole well
stuck together with mud, and having a comfortable chamber in the
center, entered only through a hole from below the surface of the
water. This is the winter home of muskrats, more than one
pair usually occupying the same nest. Near by, in the bank, is
generally a burrow, with numerous and extensive galleries, in which
they take refuge when driven from their houses in winter, and in
which the young are commonly produced. These burrows, like the
houses, always have the entrance under water.</p>
    <p>The muskrat is active in winter, seeking his food under the ice,
and carrying it into its burrow or house to be eaten. Though
roots are sometimes found in a nest in winter, they are only such as
have been recently brought in, no considerable stores of food being
collected. The food, in winter, appears to consist of roots of aquatic
plants. In summer, it also feeds upon the leaves of various plants,
as well as upon muscles,

<abbr title="Et cetera">etc.</abbr>,)<sup><a href="#footnote.1" epub:type="noteref" role="doc-noteref">[1]</a></sup> of
which they consume great quantities in some of our rivers. Collecting
them from the bottom, it carries them in its teeth to a log or
stone, where, sitting upon its haunches, and grasping them in the
fore-paws, it opens the shells with the incisors as skillfully as it
could be done with an oyster-knife. In this way, large piles of
shells are collected around stones and logs, by examining which the
<a href="glossary.xhtml#conchologist" epub:type="glossref" role="doc-glossref">conchologist</a>
may often find rare species, brought from the mud
by these animals which have been more successful collectors than
himself. I have observed that those species with thin shells are
most sought for, and have often found large specimens of
<span class="taxon">Unio plicatus</span>
unopened among the piles of empty shells, the muskrat
apparently considering them not worth the trouble of gnawing apart
the valves at the back, in which manner the heavy shells are
sometimes opened.</p>
    <p>Muskrats are seldom seriously injurious to the farmer’s crops,
though they are occasionally mischievous in fields adjoining water
inhabited by them. I have observed ears of corn dragged to their
nests, and they sometimes make great havoc in vegetable gardens
where they show an especial fondness for parsnips and muskmelons.
Their greatest injury, however, is committed by burrowing in
embankments formed to confine water,
<a href="glossary.xhtml#milldam" epub:type="glossref" role="doc-glossref">milldams</a>
being often much
damaged in this way. They also frequently destroy artificial ponds
for collecting ice. Except in eating mollusks, and occasionally a
dead fish, I am not aware that this species departs from a vegetable diet.</p>
    <p>This species is pugnacious, and resists courageously when attacked.
The males sometimes have fierce battles, and trappers state that the
tail is occasionally mutilated, or cut entirely off in these combats.

    <p>This species was originally described as

<span class="taxon">Fiber</span> [Dumeril, <time>1805</time>; <a href="https://www.itis.gov/servlet/SingleRpt/SingleRpt?search_topic=TSN&amp;search_value=900101"><abbr>TSN</abbr> 900101</a>] used by the author is now considered to be a homonyn and junior synonym of <span class="taxon">Castor</span>. However, the species is now the type species for the monotypic genus
