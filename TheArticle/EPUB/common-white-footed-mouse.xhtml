of this species vary much in size, adult specimens
being from 2&#189; to 3&#190; inches in length. The length of the tail, as compared
with that of the body, also varies, being usually, however, a little shorter.
The colors of the upper parts also vary in different specimens and at different
seasons.

  <span role="listitem">tail, 2&#8542; inches;</span>
  <span role="listitem">hind-foot thirteen-sixteenths of an inch.</span>

The upper
parts are light brownish-yellow, with a stripe darker along the back. The
yellow color is clearest on the cheeks and along the sides. The feet and entire
under surface of the body are pure white. Other summer specimens are
bluish-grey on the back. Upper parts, of a young specimen, of a uniform
blackish ash-color, without any yellow. Though this may rarely be mistaken
for the common house-mouse, which it somewhat resembles in form, it is at
once distinguishable by its pure white belly and feet.</p>

and &#8220;Jumping Mouse.&#8220; It appears to exist throughout the wooded
portions of the United States generally from the Atlantic to the
Pacific. In this vicinity, the <span class="taxon">Mus leucopus</span> appears to inhabit the
timber only. I never observed one on the prairie. It is found in
wooded farms, where it is more or less injurious to the farmer,
carrying off and devouring grain, destroying various young plants,
and occasionally doing much mischief by gnawing the bark of fruit-trees.
On the whole, however, it cannot be considered very injurious.
Though it may inhabit grain-fields in harvest time, it is
decidedly a timber lover, and never breeds nor takes up its residence
permanently in large fields, clear of trees, stumps, and logs. Its
home is usually in an old stump or fallen log, under the bark of
decayed trees, and sometimes in hollow trees, at a considerable
height above the ground. It sometimes takes possession of deserted
birdsâ€™ nests, and occasionally builds in the branches of trees. <abbr>Dr.</abbr>
Hoy informs me that he has seen several of its nests in Southern
Wisconsin. They were usually placed among the thick branches
of a thorn, at a height of 8 or 10 feet from the ground. The nests
were composed of grass, and were of a globular form, the entrance
