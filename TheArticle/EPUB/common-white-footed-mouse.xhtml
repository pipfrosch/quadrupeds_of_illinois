    <p><strong id="description.label">Description</strong>.&#8212;Animals
of this species vary much in size , adult specimens
being from 2&#189; to 3&#190; inches in length. The length of the tail, as compared
with that of the body, also varies, being usually, however, a little shorter.
The colors of the upper parts also vary in different specimens and at different
seasons.

The upper
parts are light brownish-yellow, with a stripe darker along the back. The
yellow color is clearest on the cheeks and along the sides. The feet and entire
under surface of the body are pure white. Other summer specimens are
bluish-grey on the back. Upper parts, of a young specimen, of a uniform
blackish ash-color, without any yellow. Though this may rarely be mistaken
for the common house-mouse, which it somewhat resembles in form, it is at
once distinguishable by its pure white belly and feet.</p>
