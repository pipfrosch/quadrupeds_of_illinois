  <h1 id="spermophiles.label">Prairie Squirrels, or Spermophiles</h1>
  <p>These are with great propriety called &#8220;Prairie Squirrels,&#8221; for
their true home is on the prairie, where they replace the &#8220;arboreal&#8221;
squirrels, from which they differ in organization, to suit their necessarily
different mode of life. While the true squirrels are designed
to live in trees, and to subsist upon their fruits, the spermophiles
are fitted to inhabit the grassy plains which cover much of the
western part of our Union, their food being the prairie plants with
their roots and seeds. The form of these squirrels is adapted only
to locomotion on the ground. The body is thick and heavy, with
short legs, and, in place of the long toes and sharp-hooked nails,
by which the arboreal squirrels cling to the trees so readily, they
have shorter toes with longer and straighter nails, for digging burrows
in the earth. The long, flexible and bushy tails, which aid
the squirrels in their bold leaps, and keep them warm in their holes
in winter, would here be useless, and soon worn ragged by dragging
through their burrows. The spermophiles, therefore, have
smaller tails, that are carried straight behind them. They have
cheek-pouches, in which to carry food; and two species, at least,
convey roots, seeds, <abbr title="Et cetera">&amp;c.</abbr> to their burrows to be eaten.</p>
