tail about 5 inches long. It is a little over three-fourths the size of the
migratory squirrel, though its short hair, tail, and legs make it appear
smaller; and its form is much thicker and clumsier than that of the true
squirrels. The back is light-brown, dotted thickly with black; the under
surface is greyish-white. The tail is more bushy than that of the striped
spermophile, but much less so, as well as much shorter, than that of the
migratory species. It is not so light and active as the striped spermophile,
though more so than some of the genus.</p>

    <p>The grey prairie squirrel (grey-gopher, of Northern Illinois,)
exists throughout the prairie regions of

It is abundant is South-eastern Minnesota,
and was observed by <abbr>Dr.</abbr> Hoy, in Eastern Kansas.
It is also said to exist a great distance to the north and west. It is
found much further south in Missouri and Illinois than the
<span class="taxon">Spermophilus tridecemlineatus</span>.
It is far less numerous here than the
striped spermophile, and appears to be a less abundant species wherever
the two exist. It is observed to inhabit the thickets of low
bushes, and the edges of the timber, more than the other, but does
not occur in the woods. It is fond of digging long burrows in the
banks of ditches, and several times, I have seen it living in steep
river-banks, as well as under small wooden culverts in roads. It is
not so shy as the striped spermophile, and takes up its residence
quite near dwellings. It is also less disturbed by the cultivation of
land. In this region, it is usually found living alone or in pairs,
and I have never observed a number of burrows scattered over a
small prairie knoll like the semi-villages of the striped spermophile.
This is perhaps owing to their small numbers; for the species
appears to be naturally gregarious, and, at times, large companies
live together, burrowing within a few feet of each other, and several
pairs even entering the same hole.</p>
    <p>This spermophile exhibits a remarkable disposition to migrate
from one field to another. Not only do the males lead a wandering
<span id="page80" role="doc-pagebreak" aria-label="80"/>
life in summer, but pairs appear frequently to change their quarters,
leaving their winter burrow to breed in another, and then, perhaps,
hibernating in a third, at some distance from this. In several
instances, a company of a dozen or more have been observed to
appear in a locality where none were seen the previous summer,
and then to disappear after remaining there a year, or only a few
weeks. In the early part of summer, twenty or thirty of these
animals suddenly made their appearance, and burrowed in an old
embankment within three or four rods of my father’s house. They
seemed to have lost the shyness exhibited when leading a solitary
life, and were not alarmed at the near approach of man. They
even came about the kitchen door to pick up crumbs, and disputed
with the chickens for their food. Like the striped spermophiles,
they glided silently to their burrows when alarmed, uttering, as
they entered, a remarkably clear whistle twitter, more musical than
the voice of any other mammal I ever listened to, and as clear as
that of a bird. The same note was uttered when the animal was
hurt or much frightened. They fed upon June-grass, clover, Timothy,
and the broad-leaved plantain, and seemed particularly fond of
the leaves of the common mustard, of which some plants grew near
their burrows. Other specimens, examined in summer, had their
stomachs filled with grass alone. In eating they sat upright on the
tarsi, and used their fore-feet as hands, to draw the leaves to their
mouths, though their paws were used thus with less facility than
those of the true squirrels. Though both the vegetable and flower-garden
were situated within five rods of their burrows, I do not
remember that they were observed to injure either. A number of
young chickens disappearing, however, and the eggs being eaten in
several hens’ nests near the burrows of the spermophiles, suspicion
rested upon them&#8212;probably unjustly&#8212;and a war of extermination
was commenced. Several were shot while others were killed with
clubs, whereupon the survivors left in a body, as suddenly as they
had come, and were never seen again, nor could they be found upon
any part of the farm. I have known this spermophile to take refuge
in a hollow tree, crowding up the hole like the grey-rabbit.
<abbr>Mr.</abbr> F. C. Sherman, of Chicago, informs me that he twice saw one,
when pursued, climb five or six feet up the trellis-work and vines at
the side of a house.</p>
    <p>The burrow of this species is usually deeper than that of the
striped spermophile, but otherwise similar to it. The young, I have
not observed, but <abbr>Mr.</abbr> George S. Parker, of Pecatonica, Illinois,
writes me that he once saw five, and at another time seven young
in a nest. They appear to go into winter-quarters in the fall, and
re-appear in the spring, at about the same time as the striped
spermophile. They have been found hibernating under piles of rails,
and in corn-shocks; and I am informed of two instances in which
one has been found torpid in a hay-stack, where he had formed a
burrow in the hay. I have never heard of its hibernating in such
situations. A caged specimen of Franklin’s spermophile, kept by
Professor Baird, of the Smithsonian Institution, was active all winter;
