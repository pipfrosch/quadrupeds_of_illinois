tail about 5 inches long. It is a little over three-fourths the size of the
migratory squirrel, though its short hair, tail, and legs make it appear
smaller; and its form is much thicker and clumsier than that of the true
squirrels. The back is light-brown, dotted thickly with black; the under
surface is greyish-white. The tail is more bushy than that of the striped
spermophile, but much less so, as well as much shorter, than that of the
migratory species. It is not so light and active as the striped spermophile,
though more so than some of the genus.</p>

    <p>The grey prairie squirrel (grey-gopher, of Northern Illinois,)
exists throughout the prairie regions of

  <span role="listitem">Missouri,</span>

It is abundant is South-eastern Minnesota,
and was observed by <abbr>Dr.</abbr> Hoy, in Eastern Kansas.
It is also said to exist a great distance to the north and west. It is
found much further south in Missouri and Illinois than the
<span class="taxon">Spermophilus tridecemlineatus</span>.
It is far less numerous here than the
striped spermophile, and appears to be a less abundant species wherever
the two exist. It is observed to inhabit the thickets of low
bushes, and the edges of the timber, more than the other, but does
not occur in the woods. It is fond of digging long burrows in the
banks of ditches, and several times, I have seen it living in steep
river-banks, as well as under small wooden culverts in roads. It is
not so shy as the striped spermophile, and takes up its residence
quite near dwellings. It is also less disturbed by the cultivation of
land. In this region, it is usually found living alone or in pairs,
and I have never observed a number of burrows scattered over a
small prairie knoll like the semi-villages of the striped spermophile.
This is perhaps owing to their small numbers; for the species
appears to be naturally gregariuous, and, at times, large companies
live together, burrowing within a few feet of each other, and several
pairs even entering the same hole.</p>
    <p>This spermophile exhibits a remarkable disposition to migrate
from one field to another. Not only do the males lead a wandering
