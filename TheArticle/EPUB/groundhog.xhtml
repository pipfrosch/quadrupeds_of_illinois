    <p><strong id="description.label">Description</strong>.&#8212;The
wood-chuck is about 18 inches in length from the nose to
the root of the tail, with the vertebræ of the tail about 4 inches. The tail
is bushy, but small; the ears and legs short; the body thick and heavy; a
full-sized specimen weighing 9 or 10 pounds. The usual color of the back
is grizzly-brown, with the head, tail and feet darker; the belly reddish.</p>

    <p>The wood-chuck is familiar to the farmers of the Eastern and
Middle States. It is abundant on the Missouri River, and exists
westward to the Rocky Mountains. Northward, it is found as far as
Hudson’s Bay. In this part of Illinois, it was exceedingly rare ten
years ago, but is now becoming quite common. It is an inhabitant
of the woods, where it occupies the place that the spermophiles do
on the prairies; and, though it burrows in open fields, and in the
timber, I am not aware that it ever lives on the prairie, though I
<span id="page83" role="doc-pagebreak" aria-label="83"/>
have seen it in the prairie groves. At the East, it inhabits open
fields in preference to the deep woods. This love for open ground
is probably acquired. Here, I have most commonly observed it in the
heaviest timber, and it is said to be found most abundantly in wood-lands
in Missouri. It digs its burrow under a log, brush-heap, or
fence, or among rocks; and particularly delights in rocky bluffs.
River-banks are also its favorite resorts. At the East, dry pastures
and meadows are frequented, where it likes to dig its burrow under
a fence or stone-wall, with an opening on each side.</p>
