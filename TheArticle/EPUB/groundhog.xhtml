    <p><strong id="description.label">Description</strong>.&#8212;The
wood-chuck is about 18 inches in length from the nose to
the root of the tail, with the vertebræ of the tail about 4 inches. The tail
is bushy, but small; the ears and legs short; the body thick and heavy; a
full-sized specimen weighing 9 or 10 pounds. The usual color of the back
is grizzly-brown, with the head, tail and feet darker; the belly reddish.</p>

    <p>The wood-chuck is familiar to the farmers of the Eastern and
Middle States. It is abundant on the Missouri River, and exists
westward to the Rocky Mountains. Northward, it is found as far as
Hudson’s Bay. In this part of Illinois, it was exceedingly rare ten
years ago, but is now becoming quite common. It is an inhabitant
of the woods, where it occupies the place that the spermophiles do
on the prairies; and, though it burrows in open fields, and in the
timber, I am not aware that it ever lives on the prairie, though I
<span id="page83" role="doc-pagebreak" aria-label="83"/>
have seen it in the prairie groves. At the East, it inhabits open
fields in preference to the deep woods. This love for open ground
is probably acquired. Here, I have most commonly observed it in the
heaviest timber, and it is said to be found most abundantly in wood-lands
in Missouri. It digs its burrow under a log, brush-heap, or
fence, or among rocks; and particularly delights in rocky bluffs.
River-banks are also its favorite resorts. At the East, dry pastures
and meadows are frequented, where it likes to dig its burrow under
a fence or stone-wall, with an opening on each side.</p>
    <p>This animal is fond of clover; and where it abounds, a clover
meadow is sure to be occupied by it, sometimes to the no small damage
of the crop, which injures by treading it down around the
burrow. It is also very fond of peas, and never fails to visit a
pea-field situated near its retreat. Corn and other grain are sometimes
pulled down and eaten by it. It is, however, only near the burrows
that it is seriously injurious, as, like the spermophiles, it leaves
these with great caution, and only for a short distance.</p>
    <p>When surprised away from home, this species always attempts to
retreat to its hole, running or moving by short and awkward jumps,
made apparently with much effort. It manages to get over the
ground with greater speed than might be expected, considering its
form, though a man can outrun one in a race by several rods. It is
very watchful, and, when feeding, will frequently stand erect, with
the neck stretched as high as possible, and look suspiciously about.
It usually stands on the hind-feet, in feeding, as it frequently does
at other times.</p>
    <p>From four to six young are produced each season. These are
brought forth in the early part of summer, and, before fall,
leave the mother, to dig their own burrows and shift for themselves.
The female exhibits considerable affection for her young,
and seldom deserts them when in danger. The old males appear to
lead a solitary life, in summer, like the spermophiles, leaving the
family den to the female and young. Only a single pair of adults
occupy the same burrow. The hibernation of the wood-chuck is as
profound as that of the spermophiles. Naturally, this animal is
strictly herbivorous. Though living in the woods, it does not eat nuts,
nor gnaw bark, nor am I aware that it ever digs roots. It is not a
tree climber, though it sometimes crawls up a leaning tree, or into
the thick branches of bushes overgrown with vines, on which it is
fond of lying in warm sunny days. In this vicinity, I have often
found a number of them taking refuge in standing hollow trees,
entering a hole at the ground, and climbing up the cavity in the
manner of the grey-rabbit.</p>
    <p>When fat, which they usually are in autumn, wood-chucks are
esteemed by some as good eating, if properly cooked. They are
sometimes baked whole, or are better, if parboiled in milk, and afterwards
&#8220;potted down.&#8221;</p>
    <p>The fur of this animal is of no value, but the dressed hide is very
tough, and highly esteemed among the back-woodsmen for making
whip-lashes, money-pouches, and various other articles of use.</p>
