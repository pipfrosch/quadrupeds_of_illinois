  <h1 id="meadowmice.label">Meadow-Mice</h1>
  <p>Of Meadow-mice, we have many species, some being found in
nearly every part of the United States. They all resemble each
other; and, where several species are found in one locality, they are
commonly considered by farmers as one animal, known under various
names, as
<span role="list">
  <span role="listitem">&#8220;Short-tailed Field Rats or Mice,&#8221;</span>
  <span role="listitem">&#8220;Bear Mice,&#8221;</span>
  <span role="listitem">&#8220;Bull-headed Mice,&#8221;</span>
  <span role="listitem">&#8220;Ground Mice,&#8221;</span>
  <span role="listitem">&#8220;Bog Mice,&#8221;</span>
  <span role="listitem"><abbr title="Et cetera">&amp;c.</abbr>,</span>
</span>
while many persons call them &#8220;Moles,&#8221; though they are not in the least related to
that family. They are all of small size, with shorter and heavier
forms than the true mice; the eyes are small; the ears short and
mostly concealed by the fur, which is soft, thick and very generally
of a dark color on the upper parts; the head is large; the snout
blunt; and the tail short.</p>
  <p>The food and general habits of the different species are much alike,
though some prefer high, and others wet ground; while others
inhabit the woods, prairies, <abbr title="Et cetera">&amp;c.</abbr> All the species burrow, and none
climb trees. The common food of those I have observed is the
grasses and other herbaceous plants, their seeds and roots, and the
seeds and acorns, as well as the bark of trees, in the woods, with
grain and vegetables, when inhabiting cultivated fields. Some are
omnivorous as has been observed in their habits while in captivity.
To what extent they eat animal food, when at liberty, I am unable
to say, though it is probable that they consume some insects in
summer; and they may even obtain a few, with the pup√¶ and eggs of
more, concealed in the grass, traversed by them in winter. Some
kinds, at least, lay up stores of food for winter. All are active at
this time, moving about in the coldest weather, and never hibernate
like marmots.</p>
  <p>One characteristic, certainly possessed by all the species in
common, is their ability to destroy the products of the farm. I know
of no mammals more injurious to the farmers in Northern Illinois
than these seemingly insignificant little meadow-mice. Few, if any,
escape their depredations, though the full amount of damage done
by them is but little known; and yet they are usually thought even
unworthy of consideration. Such of our farmers as cut their corn
and leave it standing in shocks for some time in the field, as is usually
done here, will find upon examination that in many, if not
every one of the shocks, there may be found one or more pair of
meadow-mice, which have dug for themselves burrows in the ground
beneath, and have often carried thither a store of corn; while in
these, or ensconced in the protecting corn-stalks above, they have
built themselves a nest, in which they can lead a very comfortable
sort of life, regaling themselves, when hungry, upon the corn.
Now, a pair of mice will not, it is true, eat enough corn to alarm a
farmer for the safety of his crop; but let any one examine a large
field of corn, thus cut and left standing on the ground a month or
<span id="page85" role="doc-pagebreak" aria-label="85"/>
two, where these mice abound, and carefully estimate the average
amount of corn destroyed in each shock, observing that which has
been buried in the burrow; and then multiply that by the number
of shocks inhabited by these pests, and it will be often found that
they have really consumed or destroyed a large amount. In meadows,
they do much injury by devouring the roots and stems of Timothy,
clover, and other plants used for hay. This mischief, however,
is seldom noticed by farmers; or, if it is at all, in districts where
moles abound, all the blame is laid upon them, as indeed, is very
much of the damage done by meadow-mice wherever the two exist
together. They also do great mischief by killing young plants in
grain-fields; and, soon after the seed is sown, they destroy many of
the grains, little stores of which may be found collected in shallow
excavations. These are often not eaten, and, germinating, astonish
and scandalize the farmer by the appearance of a thick clump of
plants where he thought he had sown his seed quite uniformly.
They also dig up grain that has just sprouted; and, by examining
fields of young wheat, oats, <abbr title="Et cetera">&amp;c.</abbr>, spots will be seen where they have
dug down, guided by the growing blades, and taken off the grain.
In a nursery, where apple-seeds were planted in autumn, I have
observed that, during fall and spring, so many of the seeds were
dug up by these mice as to leave long gaps in the rows of seedlings,
the empty shells of the seeds being found lying about the rows from
which they had been taken. They congregate in stacks of grain
and hay, sometimes in exceedingly great numbers, destroying all the
lower parts, by cutting galleries through them in every direction.</p>
